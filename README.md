CBT

Notes:
1. Essentially I tried to design the header as a component that can fit within any area of the site/application. It is responsive and adaptive and will fit to any screen size.

2. I adjusted the time and time-zone abbreviation to update based on geographical location for global use.

3. The data table comes with basic filtering functions to search by city name or populaton density, the ability to sort alphabetically, and ascend/descend by density.

4. The table also has the option to adjust the number of results per page.

5. There was no requirement for how often data should be refreshed, so by default and considering a census occurs every ten years, there is none. It didn't seem necessary to have to refresh data constantly. It is worth noting that data initially can be lazy-loaded and once done can also be cached for future visits.

6. Depending on what the user is primarily utilizing the table for, can help clarify if there are other quality of life features that can be added as part of the products core functionality. 
    EX. If someone is only searching for cities near their physical location, a feature to list those closest in proximity can be displayed.

7. Why is there a feature to add rows with city name and density if it will not be saved, only to reenter it when revisiting.

**It was very unclear what this project is for, giving it vagueness to how to design/build around it and to create a minimum viable product.**
